  <h1>Personal Website</h1>
  <p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>
  <p>-------------------------------</p>
  <h1>Why a personal website?</h1>
  <p>I've always found the idea of having my own website where I put all my achievements, work, (maybe even a few 3am unhinged literary pieces) and more on. Unfortunately, I haven't touched HTML/CSS/JS in years, which made it too hard to get started... until now!</p>
  <h1>Why not Squarespace/Figma/Wix/[insert-webite-builder-here]</h1>
  <p>Because I don't want to be boring. I've tried wix before, but unless you're willing to pay an arm and a leg your websites are going to look very obviously templeted. They also try and swindle you out of money for domains, removing banners, having basic features, etc. I'd rather suffer through making my own site, thank you very much.</p>
  <h1>Why did you use Tailwind?</h1>
  <p>It's easy. That's pretty much it. I hate making CSS classes and would prefer to just stick to my HTML, which Tailwind is perfect for.</p>
  <h1>Will this become a full website?</h1>
  <p>Yes! Being very new to webdev, it's bound to take me quite a bit of time, but I eventually plan to make a fully fledged website out of this! (Though I am not sure about whether I'm going to put my face, email, phone number, etc. on a public github repo.)</p>
